# Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

This project is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Application allows creation of user acounts and a secure login. A logged in used can create new posts/blog entries and leave comments under a post. A user profile page has visibility of all created posts and allows them to be deleted.
